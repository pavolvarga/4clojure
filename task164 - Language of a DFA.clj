;; Language of a DFA

;; a deterministic finite automaton (dfa) is an abstract machine that recognizes a regular language. 
;; usually a dfa is defined by a 5-tuple, but instead we'll use a map with 5 keys:
;;
;;  :states is the set of states for the dfa.
;;  :alphabet is the set of symbols included in the language recognized by the dfa.
;;  :start is the start state of the dfa.
;;  :accepts is the set of accept states in the dfa.
;;  :transitions is the transition function for the dfa, mapping :states тип :alphabet onto :states.
;;
;; write a function that takes as input a dfa definition (as described above) and returns a 
;; sequence enumerating all strings in the language recognized by the dfa. 
;; note: although the dfa itself is finite and only recognizes finite-length strings it can still 
;; recognize an infinite set of finite-length strings. and because stack space is finite, 
;; make sure you don't get stuck in an infinite loop that's not producing results every so often!

; WORKS in clojure 1.7.0 only for the first and second test
; returns full collection (not a lazy collection)
; expects transition from state to state to be only for a single character
; will get stuck for tests 4, 5, 6
